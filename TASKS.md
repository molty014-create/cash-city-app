# TASKS.md - Malty's Work Queue

*Priority-ordered task queue. I pick from the top and work down.*

## How This Works
- Will adds tasks here or tells me to add them
- Tasks are priority-ordered (top = most important)
- I work through them systematically
- Completed tasks move to the Done section with notes
