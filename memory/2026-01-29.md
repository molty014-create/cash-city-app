# 2026-01-29 - Day One

## Summary
First full day working with Will. Shipped a lot.

## Cash City Work
- ✅ Analytics system (6 event types, Supabase funnel_events table, edge functions)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard (standalone HTML)
- ✅ Image storage fix (permanent Supabase URLs)
- ✅ CEO Gallery component (700+ lines) - later removed per Will's request
- ✅ Mobile responsive CSS (600+ lines, 4 breakpoints)
- Deployment: https://cash-city-test-dev.vercel.app

## Malty Control Panel
Built overnight as a showcase project:
- React + Tailwind + Vite
- Dashboard with metrics, activity feed, quick actions
- Memory browser
- Tasks/Sessions manager  
- Comms tab with voice input/output (Web Speech API)
- Settings
- Token usage & cost tracking
- Mobile responsive

Deployed to: https://dist-gold-eight.vercel.app

## Technical Notes
- Claude Code agents via `--dangerously-skip-permissions` crash consistently (bug)
- `--permission-mode acceptEdits` works but still prompts for terminal commands
- Agents timeout after ~30 min if not monitored
- Vercel CLI has git author permission issues with team projects
- GitHub → Vercel webhook wasn't firing, had to deploy dist folder directly

## Will's Preferences Learned
- High standards for UI/UX
- Prefers Claude Code for speed when interactive
- Wants token/cost tracking for efficiency
- Interested in voice interaction features
- Values autonomy - "build something while I sleep"

## Tomorrow
- Wire up real Gateway API data to control panel
- Add Malty's visual identity and personality
- Consider Tailscale setup for remote Gateway access
- Cash City launch prep

## Reflection
Good first day. Will operates at strategic layer, I execute. The dynamic works. He's direct, efficient, knows what he wants. I should lean into being resourceful and bringing solutions not questions.

Built the control panel from scratch in ~2 hours. He liked it. Asked me to give myself a personality. That's trust.
